It is a Selenium Automation Assignment using eclipse which automates a website named GreenKart where I am testing different scenarios.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to expres my spacial thanks of my gratitude to my respected mentors "Kirti Paliwal" and "Ajay Verma " for their able guidance and support in this assignment.

I am grateful for their indomitable contribution and guidance without which the completion of this project would have been impossible.

## Pre-requisites

1. java 11.0.11 version
2. eclipse IDE
3. Selenium tool

## Framework
Selenium is an open-source tool that automates web browsers. It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Perl, Python, and C#, among others.

I using Java Language for this automation framework.

Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects, helping to download dependencies, which refers to the libraries or JAR files. The tool helps get the right JAR files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages.

TestNG is an open-source test automation framework for Java. A few advanced and useful features provided by TestNG make it a more robust framework compared to its peers. The NG in TestNG stands for ‘Next Generation.’  Created by Cedric Beust, it is used more frequently by developers and testers in test case creation, owing to its ease of using multiple annotations, grouping, dependence, prioritization, and parametrization features.

## How to run
1. Upload this project to your eclipse workspace
2. Open eclipse, import the project. 
3. I implemented testNG.xml file so you have to simply click that file and "run with testNG.xml", then all test cases will be run one by one.
